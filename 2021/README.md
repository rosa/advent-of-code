_Hyper_ Polyglot challenge! This year I try to do every problem using a different language, without repeating any of the languages I used in [my previous polyglot challenge in 2019](https://github.com/rosa/advent-of-code/tree/main/2019). Learning experience or pointless self-inflicted brain damage? The line that separates both is too thin.
